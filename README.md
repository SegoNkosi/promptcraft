This is a AI prompt platform where people can discover and share prompts with each other.

PromptCraft, an AI-powered platform designed to bridge the gap for AI enthusiasts, content creators, and developers who are on the hunt for high-quality AI prompts. As AI models like ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Midjourney gain popularity, one common challenge is finding effective and optimized prompts. PromptCraft is here to solve that issue by creating a collaborative space where users can discover, share, and search for the best AI prompts.

below is the documentation for Next.js as I used it in this project.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
